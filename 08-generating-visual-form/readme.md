# Gestalt and Time

In this lecture we will learn how to:

* work with time series
* identify events as basic forms
* transmit events via OSC
* group events using gestalt laws
* create visual representations of the events


## Event Detection

**Input:** Continuous data  
**Output:** Sequence of events

Event Attributes:

* Onset
* Type
* Intensity
* Duration

## Event Transmission

* Open Sound Control (OSC)

## Event Grouping

* **Input:** Sequence of Events  
* **Output:** Nested Events 

# Generating Visual Form

* **Input:** Nested Events  
* **Output:** Visual Form
