Compression Game
================

### Players

* Number of players: `n` > 3
* Number of groups:  `g` > 2
* Players can be evenly devided into groups: `n` % `g` = 0
* Number of messages:  `m` > 1

### Material

* `n` pens
* `m` pieces of paper, with messages printed on them
* `m` x `n` blank pieces of paper 

### Play

0. Each player gets `m`blank pieces of paper and a pen,
1. The Players of each group form a transmission line
2. The first player of each line gets a message
3. The player transcribes the message using pen and paper (no talking)
4. The player passes the message on to the next player
5. goto 2

### Result

##### Speed Score:

* `Total Transmission time of the slowest group` - `total transmission time of the current group`

##### Error Score:

* For each Message: `Length of the original message` - `length of the longest matching sequence in the final message`

##### Total Score:

* `Total Score` = `Speed Score` - 10 x `Error Score`

### Variant

The players get a sample message, and have a secret team meeting (ca 10 minutes)to come up with a way to speed up their transmission before the game starts.


### Discuss

* What ways are there to speed up the transmission?
  * Without prior communication
  * With prior communication
  
* What ways are there to make sure there is no error in the transmission?
  * Without prior communication
  * With prior communication
  
* Are there any parallels to the way computers transmit messages
  * What's similar?
  * What's different?
