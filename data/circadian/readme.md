## Data

### gerbil ####

This data set contains a single file (gerbil.hp).

The file contains heat production data (in watts) for a 113 g male fat-tailed gerbil (Pachyuromys duprasi) maintained at an environmental temperature of 24°C for 6 consecutive days. Lights were on daily from 1200 to 2400 h (files start at 0000 h).

Data resolution is 6 min. (Thus, the file contains 1,440 data points.)

### goat ###

This data set contains 6 files (goat1.ure, goat2.ure, ..., goat6.ure). 

The files contain data on blood concentration of urea (in mmol/l) for individual goats (Capra hircus) maintained at an environmental temperature of 19°C for 10 consecutive days. Lights were on daily from 0800 to 2000 h; feed was presented at 0800 h (files start at 0800 h). 

Data resolution is 3 h. (Thus, each file contains 80 data points.)

### hamster ###

This data set contains 6 files (hamster1.whl through hamster6.whl). 

The files contain running-wheel activity data for 2-month-old golden hamsters (Mesocricetus auratus) maintained in constant darkness at 24°C for 13 days. Files hamster1.whl and hamster2.whl refer to homozygous tau-mutant hamsters, files hamster3.whl and hamster4.whl to heterozygous tau-mutant hamsters, and files hamster5.whl and hamster6.whl to wild-type hamsters. 

Data resolution is 6 min. (Thus, each file contains 3,120 data points.)

### horse ###

This data set contains 5 files (horse1.tb, horse2.tb, ..., horse5.tb). 

The files contain body temperature data (measured 15 cm into the rectum, in °C) for individual Thoroughbred female horses (Equus caballus) maintained at an environmental temperature of 13°C for 10 consecutive days. Lights were on daily from 0800 to 1700 h (files start at 0800 h). 

Data resolution is 2 h. (Thus, each file contains 120 data points.)

### human ###

This data set contains 3 files (SBP.txt, DBP.txt, and HR.txt). 

The files contain data for systolic blood pressure (mm Hg), diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg), and heart rate (beats per minute) of a sedentary 47-year-old male (Homo sapiens) living a normal life for 7 consecutive days. All files start at midnight. The subject's average sleep time was 3:00 AM, and his average wake time was 10:30 AM. 

Data resolution is 30 min. (Thus, each file contains 336 data points.)

### nile ###

This data set contains 10 files (nile1.whl through nile10.whl).

The files contain running-wheel activity data for ten 4-month-old Nile grass rats (Arvicanthis niloticus) maintained in constant darkness at 24°C for 16 days and under a light-dark cycle for 23 days. Under the light-dark cycle, lights were on daily from 0800 to 2000 h (all files start at 0000 h).

Data resolution is 6 min. (Thus, each file contains 9,360 data points.)

### pill ###

This data set contains 3 files (bug1.act, bug2.act, and bug3.act).

The files contain locomotor activity data (crossings of an infrared beam) for individual pill bugs (Armadillidium vulgare) maintained at an environmental temperature of 24°C for 15 consecutive days. Lights were on daily from 0800 to 2000 h (files start at 0000 h).

Data resolution is 6 min. (Thus, each file contains 3,600 data points.)

### rat ###

This data set contains 6 files (rat1.tb, rat1.hp, rat1.hl, rat2.tb, rat2.hp, rat2.hl).

The files contain data on the body temperature (in °C), metabolic heat production (in W), and dry heat loss (in W) of two rats (Rattus norvegicus) maintained in constant darkness at 24°C for 4 days. 

Data resolution is 6 min. (Thus, each file contains 960 data points.)

### tupaia ###

This data set ontains 4 files (tupaia14.prn, tupaia20.prn, tupaia26.prn, and tupaia32.prn).

The files contain body temperature data (in °C) for a 173 g male tree shrew (Tupaia belangeri) maintained at an environmental temperature of 14, 20, 26, and 32°C, respectively. Each file corresponds to 4 consecutive days. Lights were on daily from 1200 to 2400 h (files start at 0000 h). 

Data resolution is 6 min. (Thus, each file contains 960 data points.)
